  comment   = {Many interesting facts about CTCF DNA binding sites. Important citations on page 2:

The effort to computationally identify potential insulators in the human genome has beenhampered by an incomplete understanding of the DNA recognition sequence of CTCF.Biochemical assays have indicated that the 11-zinc-finger protein can use differentcombinations of the zinc-finger domains to bind different DNA target sequences (Filippova etal., 1996; Ohlsson et al., 2001). Thus, the CTCF binding sites identified from in vitro protein/DNA interaction assays and a limited number of known insulators exhibit extensive sequencevariation and not enough specificity for genome-wide prediction of CTCF binding (Ohlssonet al., 2001). Recently, an attempt has been made to systematically isolate insulators in themouse genome through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cloning and sequencing(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2004). Unfortunately, due to a limited scale of the sequencing effort,only about 200 DNA-fragments with the enhancer-blocking activity, each driven by variousCTCF binding sites, have been identified. However, no consensus of CTCF binding motif hasbeen so far reported from this study.

Used phastCon to check if identified binding sites are conserved across species.
Report correlation with number of genes on chromosome.
